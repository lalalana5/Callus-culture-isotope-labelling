# Callus-culture-isotope-labelling
Scripts and batch files for analysing isotopic labelling in  Aconitum plicatum callus culture metabolomics



This repository contains the MZmine batch files and a Python script used in the analysis of callus culture feeding experiments with isotopically labelled ethanolamine and ethylamine. The workflow includes data preprocessing in MZmine and post-processing in Python to assess the incorporation patterns of labelled substrates in metabolic features. The files were used in a computational metabolomics pipeline applied to LC-MS data from Aconitum plicatum callus cultures.
